# Tort - Torrenting Made Simple

**Tort** is a streamlined torrenting tool designed to simplify the painful process of finding and downloading torrents. It scrapes indexers to provide a list of sources based on size, seeders, name, and other criteria. Additionally, it integrates with RealDebrid to fetch high-speed download links for selected torrents.

## How It Works

* Scrapes supported torrent indexers to gather available torrents.
* Displays torrent options sorted by size, seeders, name, and more.
* Allows the user to connect their RealDebrid account to get premium download links for torrents.

## Current Indexers

* [ ] The Pirate Bay
* [ ] 1337x
* [ ] RARBG
* [ ] YTS.mx
* [ ] LimeTorrents

## TODO

* [ ] Implement indexer scraping functionality.
* [ ] Add RealDebrid API integration.
* [ ] Implement torrent downloading via RealDebrid
* [ ] Full CLI integration to search/select/download.
